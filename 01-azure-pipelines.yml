# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

trigger:
- master

pool:

# Pipelins > Stages > Jobs(Steps)
# Stages like Qa,Dev, Uat, Prod
# if we have only one Job then no need to define stages and job.

  - script: echo Hello, world, changed!

      echo Add other tasks to build, test, and deploy your project.
      echo See https://aka.ms/yaml
    displayName: 'Run a multi-line script'

# define dependency, so job2 depends on job1
